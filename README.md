# friend-finder

Friend-Finder is an app built with Express Server, node JS, materialize CSS, javascript and jQuery, to name a few.

The backend logic is setup as like a dating-style app, where users can enter their name, add an image URL, and answer a few questions about their personality, and find a match based on others who have similar answers to these questions.

The app is deployed on Heroku here: https://friend-finder-sm.herokuapp.com/
